## Makefile Usage

To simplify development, container management, and common operations, this project provides a `Makefile` with handy commands. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.

| Command      | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `make up`    | Build and start services in detached mode |
| `make down`  | Stop and remove containers and volumes    |
| `make logs`  | Tail service logs                         |
| `make ps`    | List container status                     |
| `make build` | Build the Docker image locally            |
| `make push`  | Push the image to Docker Hub              |
| `make pull`  | Pull the latest image from Docker Hub     |
| `make shell` | Open a shell inside the `api` container   |
| `make prune` | Clean up unused Docker resources          |

Use these instead of direct `docker` or `docker-compose` commands.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-db-cd.yml`) automates:

1. **CI Checks** (on pull requests):

   - Lint with `pnpm lint`
   - Format validation with `pnpm format`
   - Build with `pnpm build`

2. **Prisma Validation** (on pull requests after CI):

   - Schema validation (`prisma:validate`)
   - Client generation (`prisma:generate`)
   - Schema formatting (`prisma:format`)

3. **Continuous Deployment** (on `main` branch pushes):

   - Triggers a Render deploy hook via a secure secret

This ensures code quality, schema integrity, and automated deployments.

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahadathhs/blog-management.git
cd blog-management
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file and copy the content from `.env.example`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the values accordingly, especially `DATABASE_URL`, OAuth, and mail credentials.

### 4. Migrate Database

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### 5. Start the Server

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Server will be running at `http://localhost:8080`
